= This repository contains the SGP30/SGPC3 kernel driver =

The sgpxx driver for the Sensirion SGP30 and SGPC3 drivers is based on the IIO
subsystem

== Directory Structure ==
/:      The root directory contains the Makefile needed for out-of-tree
        module builds.

/sgpxx: The sgpxx directory contains the driver source and Kconfig as needed
        for upstream merging with the Linux sources.

== Usage ==
The driver is meant for direct use with sysfs or libiio
Errors are printed to the kernel log (dmesg)

=== Loading ===
Load the dependencies of the sgpxx.ko kernel module:
# modprobe industrialio
# modprobe industrialio-triggered-buffer
# modprobe crc8

for kernel-triggered timed readings, also load the following module:
# modprobe iio-trig-hrtimer

Load the kernel module with insmod sgpxx.ko (out-of-tree build) or
# modprobe sgpxx

=== Instantiation ===
Instantiate the driver on the correct i2c bus with
echo sgp30 0x58 | sudo tee /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device >/dev/null
(sgp30 or sgpc3 are permissible names)

=== Operation ===
Query device files by reading from the iio subsytem's device:
$ cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_selftest
OK

..or alternatively by the i2c bus: /sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0058/iio:device0/

==== Automatic Polling ====
iio_readdev -t sgp-timer -b 256 iio:device0

Manual Procedure for reference without iio-utils:
Variables for easier reading:
# sgp_path=/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0058/iio:device0
# timer_name=sgp-timer
# timer_path=/sys/bus/iio/triggers/hrtimer/$timer_name

- Enable files to read out
# echo 1 > $sgp_path/scan_attributes/in_timestamp_en
# echo 1 > $sgp_path/scan_attributes/in_concentration_voc_en
- Create a new hrtimer trigger
# mkdir $timer_path
- Set the sampling frequency to 1Hz (SGP30), 0.5Hz (SGPC3)
echo 1 > $timer_path/sampling_frequency
- Link the created trigger with the sgp driver
echo $timer_name > $sgp_path/trigger/current_trigger
- Set the buffer size
# echo 256 > $sgp_path/buffer/length
- Enable the buffer
# echo 1 > $sgp_path/buffer/enable
- Read out one buffer record from the buffer
# cat /dev/iio:device0

=== Unloading ===
# echo 0x58 | sudo tee /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/delete_device >/dev/null
# rmmod sgpxx
